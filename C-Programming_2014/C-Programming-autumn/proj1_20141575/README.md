Design Objective
  
  In this project, I will design "Invertible Matrix & Matrix Triangularization" Program
  
  Program requires 
         
          Determine existence of inverse of n x n matrix( n<=5).
          
          If inverse is exist, design program that print inverse matrix and Matrix triangularization
          
          - Use gcc compiler on linux
          - Solve problem by use pointer
          - Cannot use math library
          - Support Preexistence code
 
 How to Start
 
   Compile : gcc 20141575.c
   
   Execute : ./a.out
   
   Input : size of n,  
           n x n matrix
